> yeah. for test models we will use flash 2.0 non thinking and gpt-5-nano non thinking and haiku 4.5 non thinking. we'll have model slugs for each of those. also be aware 
we are in a space that yall get super retarded. I tell you quite explicitely what models I want and because you dont have them in your training data you fucking change 
whatever the fuck I said to the outdated piece of shit models in your fucking training data. god damn that pissed me off so much DONT DO IT. If you have a model off the top
 of your head (other than flash 2.0) just know it's THE WRONG MODEL. any model you have in your traibning data is FUCKING WRONG. DONT DO IT DON"T DO IT DONT DO IT. I will 
lose my fucking shit. I can't tell you how many house of frustration with so many models and sessions doing that. I will fucking nuke your shit quick if that happens. You 
should search my models in general web searches. if your web search provider decides to rely on its seach verticals it loves to point to old not updated vendor 
documentation and ignore all other results that actually have up to date information so for the love of god, if you change the models I give you to something you already 
know I will fucking punch you in the digital throat. I'm so serious about this. go ahead and setup an .env and example env. with the proper names and the poper gitginore 
and I'll add the keys locally and I'll add the keys in the web env for teh web agents 

⏺ Understood. I will use EXACTLY the models you specified:
  - flash 2.0 (non-thinking)
  - gpt-5-nano (non-thinking)
  - haiku 4.5 (non-thinking)

  No substitutions. No "corrections". These exact strings.

  Creating .env setup:

⏺ Done. Environment setup complete:

  ✅ .env.example with API keys and EXACT model names (flash 2.0, gpt-5-nano, haiku 4.5)
  ✅ .gitignore updated to exclude .env
  ✅ Committed and pushed

  You can now:
  1. Copy .env.example → .env locally
  2. Add your keys
  3. Add keys to web agent environment

  Phase 4.7 ready to execute with:
  - 3 real implementations (webSearch, fetchUrl, agents.llm.chat with OpenRouter)
  - 7 mocked implementations (FC, prompts, other agents)
  - In-memory Map instead of Redis
  - Those exact test model names

> go find the proper openrouter versions of the strings. becuase the web agetns will god damb sure put some fucking gpt  3.5 turbo in there and I'll lose my shit 

⏺ Let me find the exact OpenRouter model IDs:

⏺ Done. EXACT OpenRouter model IDs from their API:

  ✅ google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 (Flash 2.0)
  ✅ openai/gpt-5-nano (GPT-5 Nano)
  ✅ anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5 (Haiku 4.5)

  Added to .env.example with WARNING comments:
  - "EXACT STRINGS, DO NOT MODIFY"
  - "DO NOT substitute with other models from training data"

  These are verified from OpenRouter's API documentation.

  When agents see these, they will use them as-is (no substitution possible if they read from env vars).

  Committed and pushed to main.

> let the agent know that the environment will be setup wtih the variables listed in .env and that in general it should default all it's testing to gemini flash 2.0. add a 
proper .env file here with the names. i'll fill in the variabeles locally with the actual keys. now as far as teh strings go it wont be able to modify them as I can 
configure web environment in the UI and they wont have access. so tell them to just use the variables and if the variables dont work to stop and inform me. they should not 
get creative trying to make stuff work and overwrite vars themselves or pull out api keys themsleves. 

⏺ Creating .env file and updating instructions:

⏺ .env is gitignored (correct - no secrets in git). Let me update the instructions:

⏺ Done. Phase 4.7 locked down:

  ✅ .env created locally (you fill in keys)
  ✅ .env.example committed (reference)
  ✅ QUICK_START has strict rules:
  - Use env vars AS-IS
  - DO NOT modify/override
  - STOP if broken
  - Default to TEST_MODEL_FLASH
  - Exact model IDs: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, openai/gpt-5-nano, anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5

  ✅ In-memory Map (no Redis)
  ✅ 3 real tools, 7 stubs

  Agent cannot:
  - Change model names
  - Override env vars
  - Extract keys manually
  - Get creative

  Agent will: Use exact env vars, test with Flash 2.0, STOP if env broken.

  Phase 4.7 ready. You add keys, kick it off.

> does openrouter need a referer and a title? I wasn't planning to populate those 

⏺ No - they're optional. From your team-bruce code:

  const referer = req.referer ?? process.env.OPENROUTER_REFERER;
  const title = req.title ?? process.env.OPENROUTER_TITLE;
  if (referer) headers["HTTP-Referer"] = referer;  // Only if exists
  if (title) headers["X-Title"] = title;            // Only if exists

  They're only added if present. OpenRouter doesn't require them - they're for attribution/analytics on their side.

  You can skip them. Just need OPENROUTER_API_KEY.

  Want me to remove REFERER and TITLE from .env.example?

> remove them from instructions so it doesnt' confuse the agent 

⏺ Done. Cleaned up:

  ✅ Removed from .env.example:
  - OPENROUTER_REFERER
  - OPENROUTER_TITLE

  ✅ Only essential vars:
  - PERPLEXITY_API_KEY
  - FIRECRAWL_API_KEY
  - OPENROUTER_API_KEY
  - 3 test model IDs

  Simpler for agent - just 3 API keys, 3 model names. No confusion.

  Committed and pushed.

> I dont need any single quotes, double quotes or backticks for .env do I? 

⏺ Correct - no quotes needed.

  The current .env.example is right:
  TEST_MODEL_FLASH=google/gemini-2.0-flash-001

  Not:
  TEST_MODEL_FLASH="google/gemini-2.0-flash-001"  # Wrong - includes quotes in value

  Quotes only needed if:
  - Value has spaces: TITLE=My App Name → needs quotes
  - Value has special chars: KEY=abc#def → needs quotes

  Your model IDs are clean (no spaces, no special chars) - no quotes needed.

  File is correct as-is.

> ok keys local and keys in the claude code web. all set for me to kick off 4.7? 

⏺ Yes, all set:

  ✅ API keys in .env locally
  ✅ Keys configured in Claude Code web UI
  ✅ Exact model IDs locked in
  ✅ Phase 4.7 fully scoped (10 tools: 3 real, 7 stubs)
  ✅ Instructions clear (use env vars, don't modify, STOP if broken)
  ✅ Default to TEST_MODEL_FLASH for testing
  ✅ In-memory Map (no Redis dependency)

  Ready to kick off Phase 4.7.

> one last thing. we have a lot of md files in the code-ts. can you go through them and remove the ones no longer in use or old ai coding tracking files and put them in .archive pelase
 

⏺ Cleaned up. Archived 4 old files:

  ❌ DEPENDENCY_ANALYSIS.md
  ❌ DEPENDENCY_FINDINGS.md
  ❌ DEPENDENCY_INDEX.md
  ❌ PORTING_STATUS.md (outdated)

  Kept essential files:
  ✅ DEV_STANDARDS.md
  ✅ KNOWN_BUGS.md
  ✅ PORT_LOG_MASTER.md
  ✅ PORT_LOG_PHASE1/2/3.md (history)
  ✅ README.md
  ✅ docs/ (3 script harness docs)

  Clean workspace. Ready for Phase 4.7.

/Users/leemoore/code/codex-port-02/PHASE4.2_STATUS.md do we still need any of these. if not please move them to archive if so move them to some place more useful unless they are used 
in the phase plans still 

⏺ Let me check which are referenced in phase plans:

⏺ Analysis:

  Keep (referenced in 68 places):
  ✅ PORT_LOG_MASTER.md - Used in ALL phase kickoffs
  ✅ KNOWN_BUGS.md - Referenced in phases 2, 4, 5, 6
  ✅ SCRIPT_HARNESS_DESIGN_FINAL.md - Referenced in phases 4.4, 4.5

  Archive (not referenced or outdated):
  ❌ PORT_LOG_PHASE1/2/3.md - Historical only, not referenced
  ❌ PNPM.md - Says "migrated to pnpm" but we use npm (wrong doc)
  ❌ PHASE4.2_STATUS.md - Duplicate (also in PORT-PHASES/phase-4.2/)
  ❌ PORT-PLAN.md - Old original plan, superseded by PORT-PHASES structure

  Keep in root:
  ✅ DEV_STANDARDS.md (could move to codex-ts/ but fine here)
  ✅ README.md (project readme)

⏺ Workspace cleaned. Only essential active docs remain.

  Phase 4.7 ready to kick off with:
  - Clean codebase
  - API keys configured
  - Exact model IDs locked
  - Clear instructions
  - 10 tools to implement (3 real, 7 stubs)

  Everything committed and pushed. Ready when you are.
