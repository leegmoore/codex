> let the agent know that the environment will be setup wtih the variables listed in .env and that in general it should default all it's testing to gemini flash 2.0. add a proper .env file here with the 
names. i'll fill in the variabeles locally with the actual keys. now as far as teh strings go it wont be able to modify them as I can configure web environment in the UI and they wont have access. so tell 
them to just use the variables and if the variables dont work to stop and inform me. they should not get creative trying to make stuff work and overwrite vars themselves or pull out api keys themsleves. 

⏺ Creating .env file and updating instructions:

⏺ .env is gitignored (correct - no secrets in git). Let me update the instructions:

⏺ Done. Phase 4.7 locked down:

  ✅ .env created locally (you fill in keys)
  ✅ .env.example committed (reference)
  ✅ QUICK_START has strict rules:
  - Use env vars AS-IS
  - DO NOT modify/override
  - STOP if broken
  - Default to TEST_MODEL_FLASH
  - Exact model IDs: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, openai/gpt-5-nano, anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5

  ✅ In-memory Map (no Redis)
  ✅ 3 real tools, 7 stubs

  Agent cannot:
  - Change model names
  - Override env vars
  - Extract keys manually
  - Get creative

  Agent will: Use exact env vars, test with Flash 2.0, STOP if env broken.

  Phase 4.7 ready. You add keys, kick it off.

> does openrouter need a referer and a title? I wasn't planning to populate those 

⏺ No - they're optional. From your team-bruce code:

  const referer = req.referer ?? process.env.OPENROUTER_REFERER;
  const title = req.title ?? process.env.OPENROUTER_TITLE;
  if (referer) headers["HTTP-Referer"] = referer;  // Only if exists
  if (title) headers["X-Title"] = title;            // Only if exists

  They're only added if present. OpenRouter doesn't require them - they're for attribution/analytics on their side.

  You can skip them. Just need OPENROUTER_API_KEY.

  Want me to remove REFERER and TITLE from .env.example?

> remove them from instructions so it doesnt' confuse the agent 

⏺ Done. Cleaned up:

  ✅ Removed from .env.example:
  - OPENROUTER_REFERER
  - OPENROUTER_TITLE

  ✅ Only essential vars:
  - PERPLEXITY_API_KEY
  - FIRECRAWL_API_KEY
  - OPENROUTER_API_KEY
  - 3 test model IDs

  Simpler for agent - just 3 API keys, 3 model names. No confusion.

  Committed and pushed.

> I dont need any single quotes, double quotes or backticks for .env do I? 

⏺ Correct - no quotes needed.

  The current .env.example is right:
  TEST_MODEL_FLASH=google/gemini-2.0-flash-001

  Not:
  TEST_MODEL_FLASH="google/gemini-2.0-flash-001"  # Wrong - includes quotes in value

  Quotes only needed if:
  - Value has spaces: TITLE=My App Name → needs quotes
  - Value has special chars: KEY=abc#def → needs quotes

  Your model IDs are clean (no spaces, no special chars) - no quotes needed.

  File is correct as-is.

> ok keys local and keys in the claude code web. all set for me to kick off 4.7? 

⏺ Yes, all set:

  ✅ API keys in .env locally
  ✅ Keys configured in Claude Code web UI
  ✅ Exact model IDs locked in
  ✅ Phase 4.7 fully scoped (10 tools: 3 real, 7 stubs)
  ✅ Instructions clear (use env vars, don't modify, STOP if broken)
  ✅ Default to TEST_MODEL_FLASH for testing
  ✅ In-memory Map (no Redis dependency)

  Ready to kick off Phase 4.7.
