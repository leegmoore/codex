   Untracked files:

⏺ The edits didn't save properly. Let me redo them correctly:

⏺ QUICK_START still has old goals. Let me update it:

     ### Add grepFiles (NEW)

⏺ Phase 4.5 fully updated and committed:

  ✅ README.md - Explains tool migration clearly (which to replace, which to add, why)
  ✅ CHECKLIST.md - Detailed steps for each tool (copy, adapt, test, integrate)
  ✅ QUICK_START.txt - Updated goals and workflow

  New Phase 4.5 scope:
  1. Tool migration (4 tools from codex-port)
  2. tools.spawn (detached tasks)
  3. Performance (worker pool, caching)
  4. Documentation (5 guides)

  Clear what's happening:
  - REPLACE applyPatch (get full tree-sitter)
  - ADD readFile, listDir, grepFiles (missing tools)
  - Result: 6 production tools

  Everything committed and pushed to main. Phase 4.5 ready to execute.

> now let's talk about what additional tools need to be ported after this. which did we identify? 

⏺ After Phase 4.5, we'll have 6 tools:
  1. ✅ applyPatch
  2. ✅ exec
  3. ✅ fileSearch
  4. ✅ readFile
  5. ✅ listDir
  6. ✅ grepFiles

  Still missing from Rust (5 tools):

  1. view_image - Image viewing/processing
    - From: codex-rs/core/src/tools/handlers/view_image.rs
    - Uses: utils/image module
  2. plan (PLAN_TOOL) - Plan/todo management
    - From: codex-rs/core/src/tools/handlers/plan.rs
    - Manages task lists during execution
  3. web_search - Web search requests
    - From: Feature flag in tools/spec.rs
    - Searches web for information
  4. unified_exec - Streamable command execution
    - From: codex-rs/core/src/tools/handlers/unified_exec.rs
    - Alternative to exec with streaming
    - Probably skip - we have exec
  5. mcp_resource - MCP resource access
    - From: codex-rs/core/src/tools/handlers/mcp_resource.rs
    - Access MCP server resources

  Recommendation:
  - Must have: view_image, plan, web_search (core functionality)
  - Skip: unified_exec (have exec), mcp_resource (MCP tools already work)

  Add 3 more tools to get to 9 total. Phase 4.6 or Phase 5.5?

> did you do an mcp tool arelady? what's the difference between what we did and mcp_resource? 

⏺ Let me check what MCP functionality we have:

⏺ Big difference:

  MCP Tools (what we have, stubbed):
  - Call MCP server functions (like calculator, database query, etc.)
  - tools.mcp.serverName.toolName({args})
  - Returns tool execution result

  MCP Resources (mcp_resource.rs - NOT implemented):
  - Access MCP server data (like prompts, file templates, configurations)
  - 3 operations:
    - list_mcp_resources - List available resources
    - list_mcp_resource_templates - List templates (with variables)
    - read_mcp_resource - Read specific resource content

  MCP Spec has TWO primitives:
  1. Tools - Functions to call
  2. Resources - Data to read

  We only stubbed tools. Resources are a separate 790-line handler.

  Do we need mcp_resource?
  - If you want models to discover/read MCP resources (prompts, configs, data)
  - Otherwise, tool calling is sufficient

  Skip it for now - focus on core tool set. Add later if needed.

  Keep the 3 tools I mentioned: view_image, plan, web_search.

> so we need everything except streaming exec? 

⏺ Yes, exactly:

  Need to add:
  1. ✅ view_image (image processing)
  2. ✅ plan (PLAN_TOOL - task management)
  3. ✅ web_search (web searching)
  4. ✅ readFile (from codex-port)
  5. ✅ listDir (from codex-port)
  6. ✅ grepFiles (from codex-port)
  7. ✅ Better applyPatch (from codex-port, replace ours)

  Skip:
  - ❌ unified_exec (streaming exec - we have basic exec, sufficient)
  - ❌ mcp_resource (resources API - defer or skip)

  Result: 9 tools total
  - applyPatch, exec, fileSearch (current, exec and fileSearch stay)
  - readFile, listDir, grepFiles (migrate from codex-port)
  - view_image, plan, web_search (port from Rust)

  Where to add the 3 Rust tools:
  - Phase 4.5 (with codex-port migration) OR
  - Separate phase after 4.5

  Your call.

> I'm planning 4.6 and tryin gto figure out if all of what we need can go in there. and we need mcp. so adjust your list remembering what's in 4.5 

⏺ Phase 4.5 (already scoped):
  - readFile, listDir, grepFiles (migrate from codex-port)
  - Better applyPatch (migrate from codex-port)
  - tools.spawn
  - Performance optimizations
  - Documentation

  Phase 4.6 - Port Remaining Tools:
  1. view_image - Port from Rust (uses utils/image)
  2. plan (PLAN_TOOL) - Port from Rust
  3. web_search - Port from Rust
  4. mcp_resource - Port from Rust (list/read MCP resources)

  4 tools to port in Phase 4.6.

  After 4.6: 10 tools total
  - exec, fileSearch (kept from Phase 3)
  - applyPatch, readFile, listDir, grepFiles (Phase 4.5 from codex-port)
  - view_image, plan, web_search, mcp_resource (Phase 4.6 from Rust)

  Then Phase 6 can start - all tools ready for core/codex integration.

  Sound right?
