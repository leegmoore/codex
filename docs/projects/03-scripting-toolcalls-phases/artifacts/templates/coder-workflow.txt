1. Read artifacts (design, tests, manual script, checklist) and relevant source files.
2. Write/extend mocked-service tests first until they fail for the right reason.
3. Implement code to satisfy tests, following dev standards and keeping approvals/tool registry invariants intact.
4. Run manual script checklist if provided.
5. Update checklist.md (mark completed tasks) and record noteworthy choices in decisions.md.
