**Cody** is a command-line interface for the Codex TypeScript library. It provides multi-provider LLM agent capabilities supporting OpenAI (Responses, Chat) and Anthropic (Messages) APIs with tool execution, conversation persistence, and structured tool calling. Built as a TypeScript port of OpenAI's Rust-based Codex CLI, Cody serves as both a standalone CLI tool and reference implementation for the @openai/codex-core library.
