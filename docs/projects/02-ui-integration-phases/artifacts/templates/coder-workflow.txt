EXECUTION WORKFLOW:

1. Read all reference documents (project context, phase design, standards, test conditions)
2. Review checklist (understand all tasks)
3. Write mocked-service tests FIRST (TDD):
   - Create test file based on test-conditions.md
   - Implement mocks (ModelClient, Config, etc.)
   - Write tests for each functional condition
   - Run tests (should fail - nothing implemented)
4. Implement code to pass tests:
   - Create files listed in checklist
   - Follow design.md implementation specifics
   - Run tests after each component
   - Iterate until all tests green
5. Manual functional testing:
   - Follow manual-test-script.md
   - Execute each test case
   - Verify expected behavior
   - Document any issues
6. Quality verification:
   - Run: npm run format (fix formatting)
   - Run: npm run lint (fix errors)
   - Run: npx tsc --noEmit (fix type errors)
   - Run: npm test (verify all pass)
   - Run combined: npm run format && npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit && npm test
   - All must pass before proceeding
7. Update artifacts:
   - Update checklist.md (check off completed tasks)
   - Update decisions.md (log implementation choices with rationale)
8. Final verification:
   - All checklist items checked
   - All quality gates pass
   - Manual tests successful
   - Decisions documented
9. Commit and push
10. Report completion, ready for quality verifier and code reviewer

DO NOT declare phase complete until all steps verified.
