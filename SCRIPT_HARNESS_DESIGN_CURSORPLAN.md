# Script Harness Design Plan

1. gather-context — Revisit existing design notes (e.g., `script-harness-consult.md`) to ensure alignment with prior decisions and capture constraints relevant to the new harness design.
2. outline-document — Draft the markdown structure for `SCRIPT_HARNESS_DESIGN_CURSORPLAN.md`, covering executive summary, security analysis, architecture, API, approvals, errors, tests, implementation, risks, performance, and docs requirements.
3. author-sections — Fill in each section with detailed recommendations: runtime selection, sandbox controls, approval integration, error semantics, resource limits, testing matrix, implementation roadmap, and documentation outline.
4. review-and-refine — Cross-check the document against success criteria and security requirements, ensuring completeness, clarity, and actionable guidance before finalizing.
